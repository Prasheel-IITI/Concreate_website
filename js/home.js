              "description": "The Concreate club organises a bridge designing competition in which the participants have to make a truss bridge from popsicle sticks based on the given problem statement. The event aims to test one's skillset to form the best design with limited materials and understand the load transfer mechanism in trusses. <br>Before the competition a workshop is organised that focuses on interesting examples and practical understanding of load transfer mechanism.From this workshop students can have a better visualisation and better understanding of behaviour of truss bridges which could help them in the competition. <br>The competition is conducted in two stages viz load testing of bridges and analysis of design on staad pro.After evaluating different parameters, the top 3 teams are awarded. <br>Previous year in the competition the strongest bridge weighted about 350 grams and it took weight of 100 kgs.",

The workshops cover various aspects of these softwares, such as installation, basic capabilities and applications, etc. These workshops also provide a hands-on experience, in designing and drafting. To encourage the students to explore more about these softwares, the club provides assignments for practice.",
